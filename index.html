            <p>Rocky Mountain Roleplay has been open since May of 2020, growing day by day we strive to provide the upmost professional, realistic, and fun roleplay experience on FiveM. Various departments are lead by real life sheriff deputies, and state troopers allowing us to maximize the realism within the departments, trainings, and the server! We are partnered with some very big companies and communities one of the largest being "SimulatorRadio" thanks to the partnership we have access to a live in game radio stream with the new popular music everyone loves. We see the value in our members, and don't just see you as a number; we strive to ensure everyone feels welcome, and comfortable with our large Rocky Mountain family! Within our server we offer various unique and customized scripts tailored to our community ONLY: some of which include the custom Colorado state based police liveries, uniforms, police/fire station interiors, and even customized billboards around the map for people to advertise their companies, etc... We hope you come visit our discord, and end up staying to play and grow within our server! Sincerely -Rocky Mountain Executive Board</p>
